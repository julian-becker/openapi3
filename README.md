OpenAPI 2.0 data model.

The original OpenAPI 2.0 specification is available at http://openapi.io/specification/.

## Usage

This library is intended to be used for decoding and encoding OpenAPI 2.0 API specifications as well as manipulating them.

Please refer to [haddock documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/openapi3).

Some examples can be found in [`examples/` directory](/examples).

## Trying out

All generated openapi specifications can be interactively viewed on [OpenAPI Editor](http://editor.openapi.io/).

Ready-to-use specification can be served as JSON and interactive API documentation
can be displayed using [OpenAPI UI](https://github.com/openapi-api/openapi-ui).

Many OpenAPI tools, including server and client code generation for many languages, can be found on
[OpenAPI's Tools and Integrations page](http://openapi.io/open-source-integrations/).
